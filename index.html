      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
      <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">

      <header>Hello world</header>

      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:<br>
  <code> function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
  greetMe("World");
  </code></p>
      <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

    <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">

      <header>Declaring variables</header>

      <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
      <p>With the keyword var. For example,
  <br> <code> var x = 42.</code></p>

    </section>





<section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">

  <header>Variable scope </header>


  <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
  </p>
  <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,
  <br> <code> x = 42</code></p>

  <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
  <p>With the keyword let. For example,<br>
  <code>let y = 13 </code></p>

  <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
  <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
  <br> <code> if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
  </code></p>

  <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
    <br> <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
  defined
  </code>
  </p>
